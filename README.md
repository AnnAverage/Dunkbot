# Airhorn Bot
Airhorn is an example implementation of the [Discord API](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro"). Airhorn bot utilizes the [discordgo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) library, a free and open source library.

## Usage
Airhorn Bot has too components, a bot client that handles the playing of loyal airhorns, and a web server that implements OAuth2 and stats. Once added to your server, airhorn bot can be summoned by running `!airhorn`.


### Running the Bot
First install the bot: `go install github.com/hac/airhornbot/cmd/bot`, then run the following command:

```
./airhornbot -r "localhost:6379" -t "MY_BOT_ACCOUNT_TOKEN"
```

### Running the Web Server
First install the webserver: `go install github.com/hac/airhornbot/cmd/bot`, then run the following command:

```
./airhornweb -r "localhost:6379" -i MY_APPLICATION_ID -s 'MY_APPLICATION_SECRET"
```

Note, the webserver requires a redis instance to track statistics

## Thanks
Thanks to the awesome (one might describe them as smart... loyal... appreciative...) [iopred](https://github.com/iopred) and [bwmarrin](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) for helping code review the initial release.
